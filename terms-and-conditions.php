                    This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks to accept the Agreement (the "Effective

                    (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement;<br> (ii) you have read and
                    understand this Agreement; and <br> (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. This

                        Term, Customer may:<br>
                        (a) use the Services,<br>
                        (b) integrate the Services into any Application that has material value independent of the

                        (c) use any Software provided by Tvarit as part of the Services. Customer may not sublicense or
                        transfer these rights except as permitted under the Assignment section of the Agreement.<br><br>
                        <span class="subHeading"> 1.2 Console.</span><br> Tvarit will provide the Services to Customer.
                        As part of receiving the Services, Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which
                        Customer may administer the Services.<br><br>
                        <span class="subHeading"> 1.3 Facilities.</span><br> All facilities used to store and process an
                        Application and Customer Data will adhere to reasonable security standards no less protective
                        than the security standards at facilities where Tvarit processes and stores its own information
                        of a similar type. Tvarit has implemented at least industry standard systems and procedures to
                        <br>
                        (i) ensure the security and confidentiality of an Application and Customer Data, <br>
                        (ii) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of an
                        Application and Customer Data, and<br>
                        (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of an Application and Customer Data.<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading"> 1.4 Data Location.</span><br> Customer may request where certain
                        Customer Data will be stored, and Tvarit’s IaaS partner company will store it there in
                        accordance with the Service Specific Terms in that particular location. By using the Services,
                        Customer consents to this processing and storage of Customer Data for processing time. Customer
                        can destroy their data or any configuration at any point in time from cloud. Under this
                        Agreement, Tvarit is merely a data processor. <br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading"> 1.5 Accounts.</span><br> Customer must have an Account and a Token (if
                        applicable) to use the Services, and is responsible for the information it provides to create
                        the Account, the security of the Token and its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its
                        Account and the Token. If Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of its password, its
                        Account or the Token, Customer will notify Tvarit as promptly as possible. Tvarit has no
                        obligation to provide Customer multiple Tokens or Accounts.<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading"> 1.6 New Applications and Services.</span><br>
                        Tvarit may: <br> (i) make new applications, tools, features or functionality available from time
                        to
                        time through the Services and <br>
                        (ii) add new services to the "Services" definition from time to time (by adding them at the URL
                        set forth under that definition), the use of which may be contingent upon Customer's agreement
                        to additional terms.<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading"> 1.7 Modifications.</span><br>
                        a. To the Services. Tvarit may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to
                        time. If Tvarit makes a material change to the Services, Tvarit will inform Customer, provided
                        that Customer has subscribed with Tvarit to be informed about such change.<br>

                        b. To the Agreement. Tvarit may make changes to this Agreement in consent with customer,
                        including pricing (and any linked documents) from time to time and will inform customer the
                        same.<br>

                        c. To the Data Processing and Security Terms. Tvarit may only change the Data Processing and
                        Security Terms where such change is required to comply with applicable law, applicable
                        regulation, court order, or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency, where such
                        change is expressly permitted by the Data Processing and Security Terms, or where such change:
                        <br>
                        (i) is commercially reasonable;<br>
                        (ii) does not result in a degradation of the overall security of the Services;<br>
                        (iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on Tvarit's processing of Customer
                        Personal Data, as described in Section 5.2 (Scope of Processing) of the Data Processing and
                        Security Terms; and<br>

                        (iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer's rights under the Data
                        Processing and Security Terms.<br>
                        If Tvarit makes a material change to the Data Processing and Security Terms in accordance with
                        this Section, Tvarit will post the modification to the URL containing those terms.<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading"> 1.8 Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms.
                        </span><br>The Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms are incorporated by
                        this reference into the Agreement.<br><br>

                        <span class="mainHeading">2. Payment Terms.</span><br>
                        <span class="subHeading">2.1 Free Quota.</span><br> Certain Services are provided to Customer
                        without charge up to the Fee Threshold, as applicable.<br><br>
                        <span class="subHeading"> 2.2 Online Billing. </span><br>At the end of the applicable Fee
                        Accrual Period, Tvarit will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above
                        the Fee Threshold based on <br>
                        (i) Customer's use of the Services during the previous Fee Accrual Period (including, if any,
                        the relevant Fee for TSS set forth in the Fees definition below);<br>

                        (ii) any Reserved Units selected;<br>
                        (iii) any Committed Purchases selected; and/or <br>
                        (iv) any Package Purchases selected.
                        For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set
                        in the Account and will pay all Fees in the currency set forth in the invoice. If Customer
                        elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or another non-invoiced form of payment, Tvarit will
                        charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If
                        Customer elects to pay by invoice (and Tvarit agrees), all Fees are due as set forth in the
                        invoice. Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. Tvarit's measurement of
                        Customer's use of the Services is final. Tvarit has no obligation to provide multiple bills.
                        Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Tvarit.<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading"> 2.3 Taxes.</span><br>
                        (a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay Tvarit for the Services without
                        any reduction for Taxes. If Tvarit is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be
                        invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides Tvarit with a timely and valid tax exemption
                        certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states, the sales tax is due
                        on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time
                        of the sale. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Tvarit,
                        Customer must provide Tvarit with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to
                        support such withholding. If under the applicable tax legislation the Services are subject to
                        local VAT and the Customer is required to make a withholding of local VAT from amounts payable
                        to Tvarit, the value of Services calculated in accordance with the above procedure will be
                        increased (grossed up) by the Customer for the respective amount of local VAT and the grossed-up
                        amount will be regarded as a VAT inclusive price. Local VAT amount withheld from the
                        VAT-inclusive price will be remitted to the applicable local tax entity by the Customer and
                        Customer will ensure that Tvarit will receive payment for its services for the net amount as
                        would otherwise be due (the VAT inclusive price less the local VAT withheld and remitted to
                        applicable tax authority).
                        <br>
                        (b) If required under applicable law, Customer will provide Tvarit with applicable tax
                        identification information that Tvarit may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax
                        regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or
                        reimburse Tvarit for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration
                        by the Customer.<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading">2.4 Invoice Disputes & Refunds.</span><br>
                        Any invoice disputes must be submitted prior to the payment due date. If the parties determine
                        that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Tvarit, Tvarit will not issue a corrected
                        invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected
                        invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Tvarit will apply the credit memo amount
                        to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance
                        due on that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating
                        to Fees unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights
                        with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Tvarit and will only be
                        in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Tvarit to extend
                        credit to any party.<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading"> 2.5 Delinquent Payments; Suspension.</span><br>
                        Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by
                        law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all
                        reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Tvarit in collecting such delinquent
                        amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the Services, Tvarit may Suspend the Services or
                        terminate the Agreement for breach pursuant to Section 9.2.<br><br>



                        <span class="subHeading"> 2.6 No Purchase Order Number Required.</span><br>
                        For clarity, Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Tvarit
                        to provide a purchase order number on Tvarit's invoice (or otherwise).<br><br>


                        <span class="mainHeading">3. Customer Obligations.</span><br>

                        a. the indemnified party's breach of this Agreement;<br>
                        b. modifications to the indemnifying party's technology or Brand Features by anyone other than

                        d. use of non-current or unsupported versions of the Services or Brand Features;<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading">14.4 Conditions.</span><br> Sections 14.1 and 14.2 will apply only to
                        the extent:<br>
                        a. The indemnified party has promptly notified the indemnifying party in writing of any
                        Allegation(s) that preceded the Third-Party Legal Proceeding and cooperates reasonably with the
                        indemnifying party to resolve the Allegation(s) and Third-Party Legal Proceeding. If breach of
                        this Section 14.4(a) prejudices the defense of the Third-Party Legal Proceeding, the
                        indemnifying party's obligations under Section 14.1 or 14.2 (as applicable) will be reduced in
                        proportion to the prejudice.
                        b. The indemnified party tenders sole control of the indemnified portion of the Third-Party
                        Legal Proceeding to the indemnifying party, subject to the following:
                        <br>
                        (i) the indemnified party may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense;
                        and<br>
                        (ii) any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit liability, pay money, or take (or
                        refrain from taking) any action, will require the indemnified party's prior written consent, not
                        to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.<br><br>

                        <span class="subHeading">14.5 Remedies.</span><br>
                        a. If Tvarit reasonably believes the Services might infringe a third party's Intellectual
                        Property Rights, then Tvarit may, at its sole option and expense: (a) procure the right for
                        Customer to continue using the Services; (b) modify the Services to make them non-infringing
                        without materially reducing their functionality; or (c) replace the Services with a
                        non-infringing, functionally equivalent alternative.<br>

                        b. If Tvarit does not believe the remedies in Section 14.5(a) are commercially reasonable, then
                        Tvarit may Suspend or terminate Customer's use of the impacted Services.<br><br>
