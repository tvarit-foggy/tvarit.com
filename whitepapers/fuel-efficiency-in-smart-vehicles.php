                FUEL EFFICIENCY IN SMART VEHICLES
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                By 2050, connected autonomous vehicles could decrease fuel consumption by as much as 44% for passenger
                vehicles and 18% for trucks, according to the latest study mentioned by reputed firms. "The largest
                influencer in potential fuel reduction ... stems from the vehicle and powertrain resizing," asserts the
                report, introducing a situation in which people no longer require to buy vehicles customized for every
                possible use.

            </p>


            <p class="text-p">
                The problem however also lies in the existential ways of using cars or any other vehicle. People tend to
                accelerate or decelerate aggressively, producing more substantial energy wastage. Leaving the engine on
                during long traffic stops and instances of road rage are the loopholes for fuel efficiency. There have
                been multiple studies that point out that eco-driving practices like real-time traffic sensing,
                telematics, and behavior mapping can guarantee fuel savings to the tune of 10 to 12%. With the
                assessment of data on the same user behavior, smart preventive algorithms can be made. This can be a
                major revolution in increasing fuel efficiency of automobiles.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                Traffic jams are also one of the biggest bottlenecks. Connected cars, assisted with algorithms can
                communicate with each other to keep themselves moving and valuable fuel that is consumed in idle time
                and revving up the engines can be circumvented. One other nice option is Platooning in which all the
                cars line up in a formation, subduing aerodynamic drag and consequently, decreasing fuel wastage.
                Platooning has lessened the aerodynamic drag to the number of 60% which can be a big boom for an economy
                that relies on non-renewable fossil fuels.

            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                Predictive maintenance is one more fantastic feature that keeps the vehicle intact and in its best
                condition to perform efficiently. It saves a necessary amount of fuel.Another major issue that can be
                addressed is road safety. A study found that vehicle to vehicle communication helps unimpaired drivers
                avoid 80% of the crashes.

            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                With the advancement of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Artificial Intelligence, saving fuels for a
                greener footprint and economical driving can soon come to reality. Having done a few projects already in
                this field, Tvarit AI intends to keep on growing and make industries smarter and more straightforward.
