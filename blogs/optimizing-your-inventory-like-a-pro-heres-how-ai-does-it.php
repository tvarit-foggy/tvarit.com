                Optimizing your Inventory like a pro- Here’s how AI does it
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                Before we jump to any conclusion, it's mandatory to know what Inventory Optimization is?<br>
                Inventory optimization is the operation of lessening inventory malformation, a difficulty that arises
                from out-of-stock and overstock inventory situations. Excellent inventory management branches out of a
                single dispute: storing just enough stock in the warehouse such that the business keeps running but not
                excess stock to deplete its restrained cash reserves.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">And why does it bother us?</h5>

            <p class="text-p">
                Passed are the days of manually checking inventory. Artificial Intelligence helps companies leverage
                this task and invest their human resource in other productive businesses. For example- a facility
                manager can keep track of a product in real-time without even putting efforts manually. AI is now
                extensively used as a duplicate for the refrigerator and individual shelf level. This gives a chance for
                companies to keep track of total purchase orders and also to guarantee that inventory is in the
                optimization stage. When there is an inventory drop, AI will send out a repurchase order without any
                manual interference. This enhances functioning efficiency.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                Smart Managers always tend to avoid hurdles like excess inventory costs because it is highly
                unproductive and seldom results in poor returns. Their liquidation strategies typically attempt to
                liquidate stock for max return or at minimal expense.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">How can it surge your profit margins?</h5>

            <p class="text-p">
                Brands which can evade the dependency of third-party discount retailers/e-tailers will experience an
                accession in brand value and profit margins both online and offline.In the race of optimizing Inventory
                costs, brands which keep discount in-house through a factory outlet owned-asset structure are leading
                with a huge margin.

            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                Consider the case of Amazon- Amazon has intertwined Artificial Intelligence very profoundly in their
                supply chains. In almost every phase of their operations, AI technologies like time series prediction
                and reinforcement learning systems are being used. User demand, supplier backorders, warehouse
                optimization, stock levels are all being controlled by either machine learning or more complex
                artificial intelligence systems.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">The game of demands</h5>

            <p class="text-p">
                The greatest relief that has come with the deployment of AI is Accurate Demand Forecast. The basic
                framework revolves around the structuring of a time series prediction model to calculate what demand
                will be like for the following days across all items in your inventory. The perks of having such a model
                include the facility to incorporate external data sources into the system to measure if they have a
                positive impact on demand.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                One of the tricky aspects in inventory optimization is the variable nature of inventory items. Each item
                is different and needs to be managed differently. Some elements may be highly predictable and regular in
                their movement, whereas some items are maybe highly unpredictable and irregular but equally
                indispensable to keep in stock. Undertaking significance testing former to creating any artificial
                intelligence implementations enables you to learn what external data is essential and filter the list of
                items to be predicted.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">Reinforcement Learning- the next step</h5>

            <p class="text-p">However, further Advanced Artificial Intelligence can also be deployed to optimize the
                inventory operations and cost. According to study, a company used Reinforcement Learning which cut their
                32% operation cost. Reinforcement Learning is a domain in artificial intelligence where the models don’t
                merely make predictions or classifications but act on these predictions. It is a more advanced
                artificial intelligence strategy that comprises a model taking a fast charge of the inventory
                operations, with human checks and insights.</p>

            <p class="text-p">On a concluding note, it’s undebatable that Artificial Intelligence along with Predictive
                Analytics holds power to transform and ameliorate the future. Therefore, the smart managers are already
                on the roll to infuse this technology and soar their businesses to grand heights.</p>
