                The new medicine: Big Data in Healthcare
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                Currently, due to an increase in the supply of information accessible to healthcare companies due to
                incentives from insurers, payors, pharmaceutical companies, and public stakeholders. Pharmaceutical
                companies offer their motivator by evaluating drugs’ capacity to enhance patients’ health as a basis for
                reimbursement. The energies of these healthcare providers have devised a growing need for Big Data.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Here are a few applications of Big Data that we have seen in healthcare, both for business operations
                and health management:</h4>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">A. Prescriptive Analytics</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Historical data and references from patients with similar conditions is collected and structured via
                real-time monitoring, IoT, social media, and medical databases. Machine learning is then pragmatic to
                this data, forecasting the course of a patient over time. These results help physicians intrude when a
                patient is expected to bend off the prescribed course, increasing the possibility of a treatment’s
                accomplishment.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">B. Advancing R & D</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                The pharmaceutical industry has always been upbeat about predictive analytics. They use predictive
                analytics to create a data set which tells whether the patients are going to respond affirmative or
                negative to the treatment. Pharmaceutical companies will be able to gauge how well they’re doing in
                comparison to other companies, competitively & scientifically. And adding it all up, there is always
                scope to shine up the R&D. This explains why pharma companies are being high pulsed towards APA.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">C. Health Tracking</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Apart from the primary wearables that can identify the patient’s sleep, heart rate, exercise, distance
                walked, etc. there are new medical reforms that can monitor the patient’s blood pressure, pulse
                Oximeters, glucose monitors, and more. The regular monitoring of the body vitals along with the sensor
                data compilation will permit healthcare companies to distinguish possible health issue and provide care
                before the situation goes worse.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">D. Reducing Cost & Efficient Operations</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Big Data is one of the best tools to cut operations cost. Predictive analysis can help the hospitals to
                predict the admission rates and help with staff allocation to prevent over or under recruitment. A
                definite amount of healthcare supplies can be bought after a precise analysis of the history of
                operations. This will reduce the ROI sustained by hospitals and in fact help employ their investment to
                the extreme. It can save waiting times for patients since the hospital will have adequate staff and beds
                prepared as per the analysis all the time.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">E. Preventing Human Errors</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Numerous times we hear that doctors either prescribed a wrong medicine or a different medication by
                mistake. Such hazardous errors, in general, can be reduced since Big Data can be leveraged to analyze
                user data and the prescribed medication. It can be employed to validate the data flag potential out of
                place prescription to reduce mistakes and save lives. This technology can be really useful for doctors
                with a high number of patients.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                The possibilities to revolutionize Healthcare with the assistance of Big Data are infinite. Not only is
                it beneficial and crucial for the patients but also advantageous for the hospitals. Hospitals can reduce
                costs by assessing methods and treatments faster and keeping better track of their inventory. Therefore,
                it must be apt to say that Healthcare industry is considering Big Data and Analytics to be their new and
                efficient medicine.
