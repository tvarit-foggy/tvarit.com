                THE SWIFTER DRIVE- AI CHANGING THE TRANSPORT INDUSTRY
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                Each year, poor driving costs cargo millions in extra fuel per vehicle. Performing the necessary
                calculations, efficient and safe driving can save a fortune annually in fuel costs alone by reducing
                needless idling, lowering overspeeding and driving sleekly. However, with the advent of AI, it is now
                possible to minimize the errors.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p class="text-p">
                “AI has reached a level of maturity where we can safely say it will change driving, transport, and
                logistics completely.”
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Following are some fascinating breakthroughs of AI in this sector</h4>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">A. Self-driving vehicles</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Potential benefits of using autonomous vehicles include lowered costs, improved safety, expanded
                mobility, better customer satisfaction, and diminished crime. When it comes to safety, the marginal
                reduction in traffic collisions due to better management is a bonus. Automated cars are predicted to
                regulate traffic flow, provide enhanced mobility for the public, increase the fuel efficiency of the
                vehicles and significantly reduce needs for parking space, making it a necessity for the future.

            </p>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">B. Predictive Maintainance</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Not only will the autonomous vehicles be occupied with self-diagnosis but even the non-autonomous
                vehicles will be outfitted with more intelligent systems to assist proactive maintenance and pre-empt
                breakdowns. When certain conditions match up to part or machine failures, the analytics use that data to
                predict future failures. This leads to the knowledge of circumstances under which more damage can be
                done and enables the manufacturer to repair with minimal downtime for the assembly line. Predictive
                Maintenance gives us a self-servicing car and vanishes the stress.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">C. Smart Safety features</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Predictive Analytics can take modern safety features to another level, offering assistive safety that
                can predict possible accidents, forecast the behavior of other road users, and control the braking
                system relied on the road and weather situations to avoid skidding. All this can be possible with
                neck-deep analysis of the Big Data and can prove very beneficial for the citizens.
            </p>

            <h5 class="red">D. Intelligent Fuel Consumption</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                With the assistance of advanced route planning and upcoming models for transport, such a
                ‘green-streaming’ to bypass waiting at traffic lights, or ‘platooning’ in which vehicles follow each
                other at a distance calculated to be safe and streamlined, it is highly likely that the transport
                industry will save a significant amount of precious renewable fuel. Predictive Analytics can be employed
                to study the trends in fuel consumption patterns to determine when too much fuel is being consumed to
                develop an efficient system.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                With the picture looking so rosy and plush, it is highly likely that we can expect to experience the
                magic of AI in the transport system in our daily lives pretty soon.
