                PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN POWER OPTIMIZATION
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                The striking fact about the decades ahead is that we are beginning a perpetual global energy crisis and
                it will transform everything about how we live. Therefore, it’s quintessential that we optimize our
                power production and distribution to minimize losses and use our energy resources judiciously.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Here is how Industry 4.0 has come to the rescue</h4>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">1. Optimizing Power Consumption</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                One of the most primary challenges faced by the energy sector is the looming exhaustion of resources
                used for power generation, namely the non-renewable fossil fuels. The alternative sources - nuclear
                energy, wind, solar energy, etc. are still either costly or dangerous. Therefore, its high time to shift
                the focus on efficient energy management by power producers, distributors, and consumers. On this road,
                smart grids are being installed to improve performance and maintenance. The smart grid is fundamentally
                an automated system that connects all entities in the power sector, enabling them to associate with each
                other in real-time. These smart grids study the historical data to analyze and identify fuel consumption
                patterns to detect any irregularity in the system. Also, these grids can recognize the circumstances
                under which the breakdown happens. During maintenance, staging equipment can be utilized to depreciate,
                or even diminish, downtime. Real-time waveform monitoring and additional predictive analytics methods
                can be used to create timely insights on equipment performance and help dodge downtime occurring due to
                overloading, voltage fluctuations, and damages to ancillary equipment. These measures ensure that power
                usage is efficient and not disturbed by any equipment inefficiency.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">2. Patching the loopholes in Transmission & Distribution</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Even in 2020, many countries like India, face huge T&D losses. According to a study, India still faces
                20% T&D losses, albeit the fact that it faces a worrisome power deficit. However, with accelerated
                technological advances and the rise of IoT, it is becoming easier to track and monitor disruptions in
                supply. With the deployment of Predictive Analytics, data from equipment such as sensors, smart meters,
                and other communications devices can be studied to generate actionable insights for T&D companies. This
                method is called "asset analytics." It assists T&D companies in enhancing productivity based on measures
                such as asset health, criticality, and maintenance schedule.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">3. Giving the consumers their consumption insights</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                The Big Data generated by meters, costs, business policies, production figures, asset operations when
                assessed will prove to be a sustainable solution to handle the energy requirement for the future. With
                the availability of reliable data and actionable insights, consumers or the ordinary people can be
                persuaded of the urgent necessity to replace or repair energy-inefficient devices by presenting the
                details on long-term cost indications using predictive analytics. This will be a significant step to
                raise public awareness as well as minimize power requirements.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                With both the industries working together, there is hope for improvement and solution to the energy
                crisis.
