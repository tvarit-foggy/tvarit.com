            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                AI isn’t just the future, it’s the present. The time to invest is now.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                Steel mills are massive in data, and learning algorithms only get better as they learn. Steel mill
                owners confront to enhance their quality and profits glamorously from investment in AI. AI can also
                expose unforeseen business possibilities as well as operational competences. AI can concurrently
                increase safety and environmental impact – serving to prognosticate caster breakouts or decreasing
                overall plant waste and CO2 emissions.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Here are a few advantages of employing AI in the steel and iron industry</h4>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">1. Demand prediction</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                For precise prediction, machine learning models using macroeconomic data, past demand for steel,
                manufacturing activity, and the action of large consumers of steel can be studied and trends can be
                identified.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">2. Scheduling optimization</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Machine learning models can foretell when breakdowns are most likely to occur and minimize their
                occurrence. All steel mills have unplanned circumstances like breakouts (when molten steel breaks out of
                a mold during casting) and cobbles (when hot rolled steel escapes from rollers, often onto the mill
                floor). These events hold production and are both risky and expensive.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">3. Preventive Maintenance</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Machine learning models can foretell when breakdowns are most likely to occur and minimize their
                occurrence. All steel mills have unplanned circumstances like breakouts (when molten steel breaks out of
                a mold during casting) and cobbles (when hot rolled steel escapes from rollers, often onto the mill

            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">4. Predictive maintenance</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                It can utilize smart algorithms to distinguish the optimal times to maintain key machines and equipment.
                It is a hassle-free, cost-effective and productive way to run the industry.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">5. Precise percentage composition</h5>

            <p class="text-p">
                Predictive Analysis algorithms can be utilized to predict the quality of steel produced accurately. They
                can help tabulate the precise amount of impurities such as nitrogen, silicon, phosphorus and excess
                carbon to be removed from the raw iron, and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium, and
                vanadium to be added to produce different grades of steel. The quality of steel thus manufactured will
                be better owing to a more precise composition.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                AI will be the most critical competitive differentiator in business over the next 3 to 5 years. Steel
                mills are going to upgrade regarding safety procedures, operations will become more streamlined and
                efficient, and those mills and manufacturing companies who didn’t adopt AI will be left at a competitive
                disadvantage.
            </p>
