                            <p class="text-p">Industry 4.0 Market is expected to reach 152.31 Billion USD by 2022, at a CAGR of 14.72%. Germany, being the headquarter to the world’s leading manufacturing and automotive companies, is seen as a major contributor to Industry 4.0 innovations. The increasing adoption of the industrial Internet, increased focus on efficient production, single day plant shutdown costing millions of euro are the major drivers for the Industry 4.0 market.
We, at Tvarit, envision to create AI for manufacturing and focus on the implementation of Industry 4.0 in the industrial equipment sector which helps manufacturers in analysing the machine conditions in advance to avoid unplanned downtime and wastage.</p>
<p class="text-p">Based on technology, the market has been segmented into industrial robotics in smart factories, cybersecurity, advanced human-machine interface and artificial intelligence. The increasing use of industrial robotics in the automotive sector is also a major reason for this technology to have the largest market share in the market. Being an early mover in these segments, we have an advantage of tapping the huge potential in the manufacturing and automotive industry.</p>
