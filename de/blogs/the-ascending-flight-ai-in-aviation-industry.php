                THE ASCENDING FLIGHT- AI IN AVIATION INDUSTRY
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                The aviation industry has never been a passive player. With the allurement of predictive analytics and
                the emergence of IoT and AI in the fourth Industrial Revolution, avionics has taken great benefits from
                it. AI will impact aviation in many ways from passenger experience to flight operations. Here is a quick
                summary of how
            </p>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">1. Ticketing System</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                The price of the tickets can be dynamic. The multiple factors involved make it complicated to make a
                precise conclusion. Factors like flight distance, seasonality, oil price, competition, purchase date,
                airline reputation and more, impact airline ticket pricing. This is where AI comes to rescue. It deduces
                precise results from the data set and is supporting the aviation industry execute prototypes like
                expected marginal seat revenue (EMSR) and ancillary price optimization. This helps the aviation industry
                cut the cost and enhance customer services.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">2. Fuel Efficiency</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                The largest operational costs for any airline is fuel. Airlines can use machine learning algorithms to
                assemble and analyze data about aircraft weights, flight routes, distances, altitudes, number of
                passengers, etc. This data can help AI Algorithms to deduce the optimum amount of fuel necessary for
                each flight. Also, it can reduce carbon emissions and prove to be an ecological step. Therefore,
                reducing fuel wastage is an important objective for the aviation industry.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">3. Flight Maintenance</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Airlines have to be very punctual in their maintenance schedules. Airplanes being huge and always
                mobile, it is tough to move their mechanical parts and efficiently maintain them. Any unplanned
                maintenance can follow in flight cancellations and delays which cut our pockets. This has led airlines
                to adopt AI-based predictive analytics to plan the maintenance needs of several parts of an aircraft
                beforehand. This technology is called predictive maintenance. It helps cut huge maintenance and
                operational costs.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">4. Luggage Tracking</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Managing track of passenger luggage is a primary character of air transportation. Commonly, most
                airlines still use paper tags for luggage tracking. An electronic tag system that looks like a paper tag
                but displays the information electronically can be used. Passengers can then connect to the tag through
                Bluetooth devices and set up all check-in parameters.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">5. In-flight experience</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                IoT devices are being used everywhere to customize and improve the customer experience. The aviation
                industry is deploying creative measures for the same. Connected IoT LEDs and microphones to the uniforms
                of the crew members give a message- flight number and emergency guidance. The microphones assist the
                crew to directly communicate with passengers.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                All of these clubbed together have been of great advantage to the aviation industry. Therefore, AI
                technologies are considered very useful for various aspects of airline operation management.
