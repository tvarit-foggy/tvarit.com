            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                “If you’re competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being
                customer focused allows you to be more pioneering.”- Says Jeff Bezos.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p class="text-p">
                So, what does a fancy technical catchphrase has to do with a grimly business concept? Here lie the
                answers
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">What does Predictive Analytics actually do?</h5>

            <p class="text-p">
                Well, Predictive Analytics models are mainly used to predict future possibilities. In the business
                sector, predictive models can be used to analyze contemporary data and historical facts to comprehend
                customers, products, and partners and to distinguish potential risks and opportunities for a company.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                Predictive analytics is the cutting edge for the complete supply chain and the after-sales service
                landscape in an industry which is calculated to be worth more than $9 billion by 2020.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">Towards a more profitable demand forecasting</h5>

            <p class="text-p">
                When it comes to customer demand forecasting, a precise understanding of demand can help manufacturers
                improve their service after the initial sale of a product without having to inflate the costs. With the
                assistance of historical data for a product or product line, it’s reasonable to employ a time series
                analysis. A time series analysis can surface key data points- seasonal fluctuations, consumer trends,
                and weather-date purchase correlations. It is most productively utilized when applied to a
                well-established business with several years’ of production and purchase data. In case the organization
                doesn't receive a notable volume of performance data, a quantitative forecast is a much more suitable
                strategy. Qualitative maneuvering pulls data from social sentiment, expert opinions, market research,
                and comparative analyses to predict demand.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">Also, a better cost settlement</h5>

            <p class="text-p">Once the consumer demand is set, product pricing comes into the role. Presently, many
                manufacturers rely on obsolete pricing models, like cost-plus models, and Excel spreadsheets, to price
                service parts. Perversely, this leads to uneven pricing of commodities geographically. It leads to
                unsatisfactory customer experiences accompanied with missed profit chance for businesses. When using
                predictive algorithms to decide the price for service parts, manufacturers need to carefully consider
                multiple factors that can affect sales, mainly- part location, seasonality, weather, and demand. With
                these tools at their disposal, companies can unite all these stewards to tweak prices based on what the
                market will or can bear.
            </p>

            <p class="text-p">
                Predictive Analytics is the super tool to upscale your overall business strategy. After all its wisely
                said, - The measure of growth is the ability to change. Industry 4.0 is not just a flashy catchphrase,
                it’s a junction of trends and technologies ensures to reshape the way things are made, and business is
                all about opportunities, the ones Tvarit AI is always eager to seek!
