                On the road- Big Data and the Automobile industry
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                In the past decade, the world has been on the cusp of an explosion of Big Data and Analytics in the auto
                industry. This wave of progress encompasses all thought-leaders from major automakers like Tesla, BMW,
                Ford, Audi, and even Google. The players are playing with big money. Reports, from many reputed bodies,
                suggest that spending on Big data and analytics will reach $187 billion in 2019. According to them,
                Spending on Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence Systems globally reached $12.5 billion in 2017 alone.
                The spheres that have been crashing their minds are—autonomous driving, connectivity, electrification,
                and shared mobility. These exciting trends are anticipated to boost growth within the market for
                automotive, revolutionize the working of the auto industry, and head to a shift from conventional
                technologies and innovative business models.
            </p>


            <br>

            <h4>Here is where big data has set foot:</h4>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">A. The connected car</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                A vehicle equipped with internet that has fantastic features like assisted/autonomous driving, safety
                alerts, notifications about its surroundings, temperature control and much more. Most importantly it
                keeps track of the condition of the vehicle. Being such a hotshot, it is predicted that by 2020, 90% of
                new cars will have connectivity setup, making Big Data & Analytics a significant technology powerup that
                auto OEMs cannot bear to refrain.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h5 class="red">B. Design and Manufacturing</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                With the advancement of analytics, auto manufacturers are now inclined towards using data related to
                real-world driving experiences across their customer segments, the user preferences, and service
                analysis to monitor and make accurate reports to enhance overall performance. Collected data on safety,
                fuel efficiency, battery life make Design & Manufacturing process more informed and results in upgraded
                transportation systems.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="red">C. Predictive maintenance</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                Predictive maintenance is a future maintenance approach driven by predictive analytics. It studies the
                historical data to get useful insights and develop smart algorithms to detect failure patterns or
                irregularities. It helps in disposing of limited resources, maximizing device or equipment uptime,
                enhancing quality and supply chain process. Predictive Maintenance sents automated notifications about
                any future damage, increasing productivity and efficiency.
            </p>

            <h5 class="red">D. Automobile financing</h5>
            <p class="text-p">
                With big data providing exciting and useful customer insights, companies have been revolting to provide
                the best consumer experience and are also striving precise customer retargeting. By combining customer
                history analysis with demographics & geography, organizations have launched ideal financing schemes best
                suited to customer requirements. This is not only helping them flourish but also helping the customers
                get a better experience. To make it further cost-efficient, Auto Manufacturers are weighing costs,
                reliability & quality of various components within their supply chain to determine the suitable fit for
                their automobiles using Big Data & Analytics. With all the weapons in hand, the glamour of marketing to
                is shining making it a worthy asset for the automobile industry.

                Shortly, next-generation automak­ers will be evaluated based on the complete­ness of their solution and
                more five dimen­sions -Electric, Autonomous, Connected, Mobility Services and Information and not only
                by the physical, safety and performance attributes of their vehicles. This is why automakers and Tvarit
                AI are all fueled up to race with the assistance of big data and make the automobile industry nothing
                less than a sci-fi movie.
