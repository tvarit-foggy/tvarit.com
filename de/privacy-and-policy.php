                        you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us, to subscribe to
                        marketing communications from us, and/or to submit inquiries to us.  The personal
                        information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it,
                        will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.

                        In addition to the information you provide, Tvarit may also collect information during your

                    <p>
                        Tvarit does share non-personal, non-individual information from which individuals cannot
                        be identified and which do not relate to individuals in aggregate form with third parties for
                        business purposes, such as consultants and advisors to the company. Tvarit will not disclose
                        personal information to any third parties without your consent except in the following very
                        limited circumstances:<br>
                        <span class="subHeading"> 4.1 Partners and Agents.</span><br>
                        Tvarit shares information with trusted agents who provide specific services you have
                        requested and/or administer information offered at the Website, for example, service

                        providers who help manage, track and respond to customer inquiries, information requests,
                        etc. Tvarit may also share information with authorized resellers and integration partners,
                        who may be better suited to reply directly in response to your specific inquiries about Tvarit
                        products and services. Tvarit may also share information with authorized resellers and
                        integration partners in order to execute joint marketing initiatives. These parties do not use
                        or otherwise disclose any information except as authorized agents for the purpose of
                        providing the products and services that you have requested or administering the activities
                        on Tvarit’s behalf, or participating in joint marketing initiatives with Tvarit. Any company
                        that Tvarit shares personal information with will have executed a confidentiality agreement,
                        requiring that they keep all data received confidential.<br>
                        <span class="subHeading"> 4.2 Third Party Vendors.</span><br>
                        We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including
                        packaging, mailing and delivering materials, sending postal mail, processing registrations or
                        sending emails. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver
                        the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br>
                        <span class="subHeading"> 4.3 Legal Requirements and Investigations.</span><br>
                        Tvarit will disclose your personal information to a third party if required to do so by law or
                        if,
                        in good faith, Tvarit believes that such action is necessary to:<br>
                        (1) comply with the law or with legal process;<br>
                        (2) protect and defend the company’s rights and property or prevent fraud;<br>
                        (3) protect the company against abuse, misuse or unauthorized use of Tvarit’s products or
                        services; or<br>
                        (4) protect the personal safety or property of personnel, users or the public
                        (among other things, this means that if you provide false or deceptive registration
                        information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you including your
                        computer’s IP address – may be disclosed to a third party (including the recipient of an
                        email) as part of any type of investigation into your actions.<br>
                        <span class="subHeading"> 4.4 IP Addresses.</span><br>
                        An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using your
                        browser on the Internet. The servers that operate the Website automatically identify a
                        computer by its IP address. If Tvarit, in good faith, determines that you have used the
                        service to menace, threaten, harass, intimidate or otherwise deceptively pose as another
                        person, your actions will be investigated and your IP address may be disclosed to the
                        recipient of any email, their legal counsel or representatives, and law enforcement officials
                        as part of such an investigation.<br>
                        <span class="subHeading"> 4.5 Sale of Assets.</span><br>
                        Tvarit may transfer its database, including personal information contained therein, to a third
                        party who acquires all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Tvarit whether by merger,
                        acquisition, reorganization or otherwise.

                        information (EEA visitors only).</span>
                    <p>
                        If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting
                        and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal
                        information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.<br>
                        However, we will normally collect personal information from you only<br>
                        (i) where we need the
                        personal information to perform a contract with you,<br>
                        (ii) where the processing is in our
                        legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or<br>
                        (iii) where we have your consent
                        to do so.<br>
                        In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information
                        from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or
                        those of another person.<br>
                        If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to
                        perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you
                        whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the
                        possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).<br>
                        If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or
                        those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and
                        communicating with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate
                        commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform,
                        undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.  We
                        may have other legitimate interests and, if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the
                        relevant time what those legitimate interests are.<br>
                        If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which
                        we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details
                        provided above.

                        Specifically, we and our third party service providers and partners operate around the
                        world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any
                        of these countries where our third party service providers and partners process your data.<br>
                        However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information
                        will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice, such as implementing the
                        European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information
                        (which require us to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance
                        with European Union data protection law).

                    <p>
                        We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate
                        business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to
                        comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).<br>
                        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
                        we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
                        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
                        personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br>

                    <p>
                        Tvarit employs appropriate technical and organizational industry-standard security
                        procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality of users’ personal information.
                        The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of
                        processing your personal information.<br>
                        Tvarit, or agents and partners on behalf of Tvarit, do everything in their reasonable control
                        to protect your information. Where one of Tvarit’s partners or agents has access to or
                        maintains sensitive personal information, the company enters into confidentiality
                        agreements in order to ensure the privacy of such user information priori to sharing that
                        information. Internally, access to all users’ and registrants’ personal information is
                        restricted
                        to those employees who need access in order to fulfill their job responsibilities.
                        Furthermore, Tvarit employees who deal with user information are kept up to date on
                        various security and privacy practice issues as they arise.<br>
                        Finally, the servers for the Website are stored in a physically secured, offsite facility.
                        Beyond
                        the physical security of your information, Tvarit also backs up servers regularly to prevent
                        loss of data. While the goal is to safeguard users’ and members’ personal information, Tvarit
                        cannot ensure or warrant the security of any transmission and your information is
                        submitted at your own risk.

                        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you
                        visit a website.  Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites
                        work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.<br>
                        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Tvarit) are called “first party cookies”. 
                        Cookies set by parties, other than the website owner, are called “third party cookies”.  Third
                        party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
                        website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).  The parties that set these
                        third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question
                        and also when it visits certain other websites.
