                ENHANCING CPG WITH AI AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="text-medium fw-700">
                With the ocean full of ships and the sails set high, it's impeccable for the companies to shine up their
                cannons. With the flooding of Consumer Packaged Goods ( CPG) market, the smarter pirates have allied
                with AI and Advanced Analytics to regain the edge. In a study conducted, companies which resorted to
                advanced analytics gained a 10% edge over others.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>PUTTING AI AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS OVERWORK</h4>

            <p class="text-p">
                Earlier, the stacks of data collected were never considered as a valuable asset. However, with the
                deployment of analytics, traditional enterprise data, consumer data, partner data, everything has been
                consumed explicitly to generate predictions. Predictions such as demand of products, market trends, the
                impact of a marketing campaign and customer behavior.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mb-3">Breaking down the predictions, the topmost advantageous applications in CPG were identified
                to be-</h5>
            <ul class="ul-list-bullet">
                <li>Demand forecasting for new and existing products</li>
                <li>ROI measurement for sales and marketing</li>
                <li>Identification of target sales points.</li>
                <li>Optimization of products, even at an individual store level.</li>
                <li>Insights into customer trends.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h4>OBSTACLES IN EXPANSION</h4>
            <p class="text-p">
                With the changes being so significant and transfusing, there are several hurdles in the implementation
                of Advanced Analytics. Every single current decision-making process, automated manual tasks, and
                calculations, existing business process, will have to change. Also, a new set of skilled and talented
                workforce will be required for implementation.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mb-3">Considering all the factors, the following issues have been identified:</h5>
            <ul class="ul-list-bullet">
                <li>The scattered implementation and Sandy planning have been a major roadblock in the soaring
                    involvement of AI and Advanced Analytics in CPG.</li>
                <li>Due to a hazy map of how things should follow up the industry has failed to put the necessary effort
                    into industrialization, scaling up and rolling out the application.</li>
                <li>The lack of a skilled workforce in AI has also led to a major setback.</li>
                <li>Due to limited data governance, there are no certain processes for data management, quality,
                    ownership or rather common data taxonomies to facilitate scaling up.</li>
                <li>The failure to recognize how digital ecosystems, data availability, channel dynamics, and vendor
                    capabilities differ over markets has led to severe market clutter. </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h4>SUGGESTIONS FOR QUICK IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
            <h5 class="mb-3">Before scaling up AI and Advanced Analytics in CPG, the following steps can be considered
                for quicker implementation:</h5>
            <ul class="ul-list-bullet">
                <li>Filter the options- for better focus and lesser scattering; the CPGs should come up with countable
                    applications. </li>
                <li>Identify the sponsorship- before actually stepping in; it's crucial that the CPG identify ventures
                    to pivot their application. Brands should also work to guarantee that there is notable interest
                    among the local members who'll assist the application launch and marketing.</li>
                <li>Address market specific needs- the earlier these are addressed, and the quicker the issues are
                    noted, the better can new services be implemented by the brands.</li>
                <li>Preparation before the showdown- merging AI and Advanced Analytics, requires building new technical
                    ecosystems. Feeding, hosting and adapting to the new ecosystems can be tacky and require a
                    beforehand support.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p class="text-p">
                The goals and standards have been set high. Achieving them will require a hierarchical clustering to
                deploy all levels from broad level decision making to shop floor management. For a good head start, CPG
                companies should start with a handful of investments and gradually expand their nexus.
