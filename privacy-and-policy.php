            <h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

            <p>
                Thank you for your interest in our company. Data protection is of a particularly high priority
                for
                the management of Tvarit GmbH. The Tvarit GmbH website can be used without providing
                any personal data. However, if a data subject wishes to make use of our company&#39;s special
                services via our website, it may be necessary to process personal data. If the processing of
                personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we generally
                obtain the consent of the person concerned.
            </p>
            <p>
                The processing of personal data, for example the name, address, e-mail address or
                telephone number of a person concerned, always takes place in accordance with the
                General Data Protection Regulation and in accordance with the country-specific data
                protection regulations applicable to Tvarit GmbH. With this data protection declaration, our
                company would like to inform the public about the type, scope and purpose of the personal
                data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed about their rights
                by means of this data protection declaration.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the controller, Tvarit GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational
                measures to ensure the most complete protection possible for personal data processed via
                this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions can generally have security gaps,
                so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every person concerned is
                free to transmit personal data to us in alternative ways, for example by telephone.
            </p>
            <h4>1. DEFINITION</h4>
            <p>
                The data protection declaration of Tvarit GmbH is based on the terms used by the European
                legislator for directives and regulations when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                was adopted. Our data protection declaration should be easy to read and understand for the
                public as well as for our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to
                explain the terms used in advance.

            <h4>3. COOKIES</h4>
            <p>
                The Tvarit GmbH website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored on a computer
                system via an internet browser.<br>
                Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A
                cookie ID is a unique identifier for the cookie. It consists of a string of characters through
                which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the
                cookie was stored. This enables the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual
                browser of the person concerned from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
                specific internet browser can be recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID.<br>
                By using cookies, Tvarit GmbH can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly
                services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.<br>
                A cookie can be used to optimize the information and offers on our website in the interests of
                the user. As already mentioned, cookies enable us to recognize the users of our website. The
                purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. The user of a
                website that uses cookies, for example, does not have to re-enter their access data every
                time they visit the website, because this is done by the website and the cookie stored on the
                user&#39;s computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in the online
                shop. The online shop uses a cookie to remember the items that a customer has placed in
                the virtual shopping cart.<br>
                The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by
                means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object
                to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at
                any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common
                internet browsers. If the person concerned deactivates the setting of cookies in the internet
                browser used, not all functions of our website may be fully usable.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>4. COLLECTION OF GENERAL DATA AND INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
                The Tvarit GmbH website collects a series of general data and information each time the
                website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system. These general data and
                information are stored in the server&#39;s log files. The <br>
                (1) browser types and versions used,<br>
                (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, <br>
                (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrer), <br>
                (4) the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website can be controlled,
                <br>
                (5) the date and time of access to the website, <br>
                (6) an internet protocol address (IP address), <br>
                (7) the internet service provider of the accessing system and <br>
                (8) other similar data and information,<br>
                When using this general data and information, Tvarit GmbH does not draw any conclusions
                about the person concerned. Rather, this information is required to <br>
                (1) correctly deliver the content of our website, <br>
                (2) optimize the content of our website and the advertising for it,
                (3) ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the
                technology of our website and <br>
                (4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the
                information necessary for law enforcement in the event of a cyber-attack. This anonymously
                collected data and information is therefore evaluated by Tvarit GmbH on the one hand
                statistically and on the other hand with the aim of increasing data protection and data
                security in our company, in order to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the
                personal data we process. The anonymous data in the server log files are stored separately
                from all personal data provided by a data subject.
            </p>
            <h4>5. REGISTRATION ON OUR WEBSITE</h4>
            <p>
                The data subject has the option of registering on the website of the person responsible for
                processing by providing personal data. Which personal data is transmitted to the person
                responsible for processing results from the respective input mask that is used for
                registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored
                exclusively for internal use by the person responsible for processing and for their own
                purposes. The person responsible for processing can arrange for the data to be passed on to
                one or more processors, for example a parcel service provider, who will also use the personal
                data exclusively for internal use,<br>
                By registering on the website of the person responsible for processing, the IP address
                assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) to the person concerned, the date and time of
                registration are also saved. This data is stored against the background that this is the only
                way to prevent misuse of our services and, if necessary, to enable criminal offenses to be
                investigated. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary to protect the person
                responsible for processing. This data will not be passed on to third parties unless there is a
                legal obligation to pass on or the passing on is used for criminal prosecution.<br>
                The registration of the data subject with the voluntary provision of personal data enables the
                data controller to offer the data subject content or services which, due to the nature of the
                matter, can only be offered to registered users. Registered persons are free to change the
                personal data provided during registration at any time or to have them completely deleted
                from the database of the person responsible for processing.<br>
                The person responsible for processing provides information to each person concerned at any
                time upon request about which personal data is stored about the person
                concerned. Furthermore, the person responsible for processing corrects or deletes personal
                data at the request or advice of the person concerned, provided that there are no legal

            <h4>6. SUBSCRIPTION TO OUR NEWSLETTER</h4>
            <p>
                On the Tvarit GmbH website, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our company&#39;s
                newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines which personal data is
                transmitted to the person responsible for processing when ordering the newsletter.<br>
                Tvarit GmbH informs its customers and business partners at regular intervals by means of a
                newsletter about company offers. Our company&#39;s newsletter can only be received by the
                person concerned if <br>
                (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and <br>
                (2) the person concerned registers to receive the newsletter.<br> 
                For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered for the
                first time by a person concerned for the newsletter
                dispatch using the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation email is used to check whether
                the owner of the email address, as the person concerned, has authorized receipt of the
                newsletter.<br>
                When registering for the newsletter, we also store the IP address assigned by the Internet
                service provider (ISP) of the computer system used by the person concerned at the time of
                registration, as well as the date and time of registration. The collection of this data is
                necessary in order to be able to trace the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data
                subject at a later point in time and therefore serves the legal protection of the person
                responsible for the processing.<br>
                The personal data collected when registering for the newsletter will only be used to send our
                newsletter. Furthermore, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is
                necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a related registration, as this could
                be
                the case in the case of changes to the newsletter offer or changes in the technical
                conditions. The personal data collected as part of the newsletter service is not passed on to
                third parties. The data subject can cancel the subscription to our newsletter at any time. The
                consent to the storage of personal data that the person concerned has given us for sending
                the newsletter can be revoked at any time. There is a corresponding link in every newsletter
                for the purpose of withdrawing consent. Furthermore, there is the option of unsubscribing
                from the newsletter dispatch directly on the website of the person responsible for processing
                or to inform the person responsible for processing of this in another way.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>7. NEWSLETTER TRACKING</h4>
            <p>
                The Tvarit GmbH newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature
                graphic that is embedded in such e-mails that are sent in HTML format to enable log file
                recording and log file analysis. This enables a statistical evaluation of the success or failure
                of
                online marketing campaigns to be carried out. Using the embedded tracking pixel, Tvarit
                GmbH can recognize whether and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject and which
                links in the e-mail were called up by the data subject.<br>
                Such personal data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored
                and evaluated by the person responsible for processing in order to optimize the sending of
                the newsletter and to better adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the
                person concerned. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Affected
                persons are entitled at any time to revoke the relevant separate declaration of consent given
                via the double opt-in procedure. After a revocation, this personal data will be deleted by the
                person responsible for processing. Tvarit GmbH automatically interprets a cancellation from
                the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.
            </p>
            <h4>8. CONTACT OPTIONS VIA THE WEBSITE</h4>
            <p>
                Due to legal regulations, the Tvarit GmbH website contains information that enables quick
                electronic contact with our company and direct communication with us, which also includes
                a general address for so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the
                person responsible for processing by email or a contact form, the personal data transmitted
                by the data subject will be automatically saved. Such personal data transmitted on a
                voluntary basis by a data subject to the person responsible for processing are stored for the
                purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.
            </p>
            <h4>9. COMMENT FUNCTION IN THE BLOG ON THE WEBSITE</h4>
            <p>
                Tvarit GmbH offers users the opportunity to leave individual comments on individual blog
                posts on a blog located on the website of the controller. A blog is a website that is usually
                open to the public and in which one or more people called bloggers or web bloggers can
                post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blog posts. The blog posts can usually be
                commented on by third parties.<br>
                If a person concerned leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, in addition to
                the comments left by the person concerned, information on the time the comment was
                entered and the user name (pseudonym) chosen by the person concerned are stored and
                published. Furthermore, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the
                person concerned is also logged. The IP address is stored for security reasons and in the
                event that the person concerned violates the rights of third parties or posts illegal content by
                submitting a comment. The storage of this personal data is therefore in the own interest of
                the person responsible for the processing, so that he can exculpate himself in the event of an
                infringement.
            </p>
            <h4>10. SUBSCRIPTION TO COMMENTS IN THE BLOG ON THE WEBSITE</h4>
            <p>
                The comments posted on the Tvarit GmbH blog can generally be subscribed to by third
                parties. In particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments on
                a specific blog post that follow his comment.<br>
                If a data subject opts for the option to subscribe to comments, the person responsible for
                processing sends an automatic confirmation e-mail in order to use the double opt-in
                procedure to check whether the owner of the e-mail address provided is really the same
                Option has decided. The option to subscribe to comments can be canceled at any time.
            </p>
            <h4>11. ROUTINE DELETION AND BLOCKING OF PERSONAL DATA</h4>

                the European directives and regulations or another legislator in laws or regulations, which the
                person responsible for processing is subject to, was provided.<br>
                If the purpose of storage no longer applies or if a storage period prescribed by the European
                directives and regulations or another responsible legislator expires, the personal data will be
                routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.

                <p>
                Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
                European legislator of directives and regulations to demand that the controller restrict
                the processing if one of the following conditions is met:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The correctness of the personal data is contested by the data subject for a
                    period of time that enables the controller to check the correctness of the

                </li>
                <li>
                    The person concerned has an objection to the processing in accordance
                    with. Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and it has not yet been determined whether the
                    legitimate reasons of the controller outweigh those of the person concerned.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If one of the above conditions is met and a data subject would like to request the
            restriction of personal data stored at Tvarit GmbH, they can contact an employee of
            the person responsible for processing at any time. The employee of Tvarit GmbH will
            arrange for the processing to be restricted.

                <h4>F) RIGHT TO DATA PORTABILITY</h4>
                <p>
                Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
            European legislator of directives and regulations to receive the personal data
            concerning them, which have been provided by the person concerned to a controller,
            in a structured, common and machine-readable format. You also have the right to
            transfer this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to whom
            the personal data was provided, provided that the processing is based on the consent
            in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 Letter a GDPR or Art. 9 Para 2 letter a DS-GVO or on a
            contract according to Art. 6 para. 1 letter b DS-GVO and the processing is carried out
            using automated procedures,<br>
            Furthermore, when exercising their right to data portability in accordance with Art. 20
            (1) GDPR, the person concerned has the right to have the personal data transmitted
            directly from one controller to another, insofar as this is technically feasible and if this
            does not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.<br>
            In order to assert the right to data portability, the person concerned can contact an
            employee of Tvarit GmbH at any time.

                </li>
                <li>
                <h4>G) RIGHT TO OBJECT</h4>
                <p>
                Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
            European legislator of directives and regulations to object at any time to the

            or f DS-GVO takes place to object. This also applies to profiling based on these
            provisions.<br>
            In the event of an objection, Tvarit GmbH will no longer process the personal data,
            unless we can prove compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that outweigh
            the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves to
            assert, exercise or defend of legal claims.<br>
            If Tvarit GmbH processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data
            subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for the
            purpose of such marketing. This also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such
            direct marketing. If the data subject objects to Tvarit GmbH processing for the
            purposes of direct marketing, Tvarit GmbH will no longer process the personal data
            for these purposes.<br>
            In addition, the data subject has the right, for reasons arising from their particular
            situation, to object to the processing of personal data concerning them that is carried
            out by Tvarit GmbH for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical
            purposes in accordance with Art. 89 Para. 1 DS- GMOs, to object, unless such
            processing is necessary to fulfill a task in the public interest.<br>
            To exercise the right to object, the person concerned can contact any employee of
            Tvarit GmbH or another employee directly. The data subject is also free, in connection
            with the use of information society services, regardless of Directive 2002/58 / EC, to
            exercise their right of objection by means of automated procedures in which technical
            specifications are used.

                <p>
                Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
            European <b>legislator of directives and regulations not to be subjected to a decision
                based solely on automated </b>processing - including profiling - which has legal effects
            on them or which significantly affects them in a similar manner, if the decision<br>

            <h4>13. DATA PROTECTION IN APPLICATIONS AND IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS</h4>
            <p>
                The person responsible for processing collects and processes the personal data of
                applicants for the purpose of handling the application process. The processing can also be
                done electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant sends the relevant
                application
                documents electronically, for example by e-mail or via a web form on the website, to the
                person responsible for processing. If the person responsible for processing concludes an
                employment contract with an applicant, the data transmitted will be stored for the purpose of
                processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If the
                person responsible for processing does not conclude an employment contract with the
                applicant, the application documents will be automatically deleted two months after
                notification of the rejection decision, provided that deletion does not conflict with any other
                legitimate interests of the person responsible for processing. Another legitimate interest in
                this sense is, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal
                Treatment Act (AGG).

            <h4>14. DATA PROTECTION PROVISIONS ON THE APPLICATION AND USE OF
                FACEBOOK</h4>
            <p>
                The person responsible for processing has integrated components of the company
                Facebook on this website. Facebook is a social network.<br>
                A social network is a social meeting place operated on the Internet, an online community that
                usually enables users to communicate with one another and to interact in virtual space. A
                social network can serve as a platform for exchanging opinions and experiences, or it enables
                the Internet community to provide personal or company-related information. Among other
                things, Facebook enables users of the social network to create private profiles, upload
                photos and network via friend requests.<br>
                The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025,
                USA. If a data subject lives outside the USA or Canada, the person responsible for processing
                personal data is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2,
                Ireland.<br>
                Each time one of the individual pages of this website is called up, which is operated by the
                person responsible for processing and on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in)
                has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
                person concerned is automatically activated by the respective Facebook -Component
                causes a representation of the corresponding Facebook component to be downloaded from
                Facebook. A complete overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at
                <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE"
                    target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE</a> . As part of
                this technical
                process, Facebook receives knowledge of which specific subpage of our website is visited by
                the person concerned.<br>
                If the person concerned is logged in to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes
                which specific subpage of our website the person concerned is visiting each time the person
                concerned visits our website and for the entire duration of their stay on our website. This
                information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned to the respective
                Facebook account of the person concerned by Facebook. If the person concerned activates
                one of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the “Like” button, or if
                the person concerned makes a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the
                concerned person’s personal Facebook user account and saves this personal data.<br>
                Facebook always receives information via the Facebook component that the person
                concerned has visited our website if the person concerned is logged into Facebook at the
                same time as accessing our website; this takes place regardless of whether the person
                concerned clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the data subject does not want this
                information to be transmitted to Facebook, they can prevent the transmission by logging out
                of their Facebook account before calling up our website.<br>
                The data guideline published by Facebook, which is available at
                <a href="https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">
                    https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>, provides information about the collection,
                processing and
                use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains which setting options Facebook offers to
                protect the privacy of the data subject. Various applications are also available that make it
                possible to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the
                data subject to suppress data transmission to Facebook.

                ANALYTICS
                (WITH ANONYMIZATION
                FUNCTION)</h4>
            <p>
                The person responsible for processing has integrated the Google Analytics component (with
                anonymization function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web
                analysis is the gathering, collection and evaluation of data on the behavior of visitors to
                websites. A web analysis service collects, among other things, data on the website from
                which a person concerned came to a website (so-called referrer), which sub-pages of the
                website were accessed or how often and for how long a sub-page was viewed. A web
                analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of Internet
                advertising. <br>
                The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited,
                Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.<br>
                The person responsible for processing uses the addition &quot;_gat._anonymizeIp&quot; for web
                analysis
                via Google Analytics. By means of this addition, the IP address of the Internet connection of
                the person concerned is shortened and anonymized by Google if our Internet pages are
                accessed from a member state of the European Union or from another signatory to the
                Agreement on the European Economic Area.<br>
                The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our
                website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other things, to evaluate the
                use of our website, to compile online reports for us that show the activities on our website,
                and to provide other services related to the use of our website.<br>
                Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the person
                concerned. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie,
                Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of
                this website is accessed, which is operated by the person responsible for processing and on
                which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the
                information technology system of the person concerned is automatically triggered by the
                respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online
                analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such
                as the IP address of the person concerned, which Google uses, among other things, to trace
                the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently to enable commission settlements.<br>
                The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from
                which access was made and the frequency of visits to our website by the person
                concerned. Each time you visit our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the
                Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the United
                States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of
                America. Google may pass this personal data collected through the technical process on to
                third parties.<br>
                The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already shown
                above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and
                thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the internet browser used
                would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of
                the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at
                any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.<br>
                Furthermore, the data subject has the option of objecting to the collection of the data
                generated by Google Analytics relating to the use of this website and the processing of this
                data by Google and to prevent such. To do this, the person concerned must download and
                install a browser add-on under the link <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
                    target="_blank"> https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout </a>. This
                browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data or information on
                website visits may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on
                will be considered an objection by Google. If the data subject&#39;s information technology
                system is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later date, the person concerned must
                reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is
                uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned or another person who is attributable to
                their sphere of control, there is the option of reinstalling or reactivating the browser
                add-on.<br>

                GOOGLE+</h4>
            <p>
                The person responsible for processing has integrated the Google+ button as a component on
                this website. Google+ is a so-called social network. A social network is a social meeting place
                operated on the Internet, an online community that usually enables users to communicate
                with one another and interact in virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for
                exchanging opinions and experiences, or it enables the Internet community to provide
                personal or company-related information. Google+ enables users of the social network,
                among other things, to create private profiles, upload photos and network via friend
                requests.<br>
                Google+ is operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04
                E5W5, Ireland.<br>
                Each time one of the individual pages of this website is accessed, which is operated by the
                person responsible for processing and on which a Google+ button has been integrated, the
                Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is
                automatically prompted by the respective Google+ button to display the corresponding
                Google+ Download button from Google. As part of this technical process, Google gains
                knowledge of which specific subpage of our website is visited by the person
                concerned. More detailed information on Google+ is available at
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/" target="_blank">
                    https://developers.google.com/+/ </a>. <br>
                If the person concerned is logged in to Google+ at the same time, Google recognizes which
                specific subpage of our website the person concerned is visiting with each visit to our
                website by the person concerned and for the entire duration of the respective stay on our
                website. This information is collected by the Google+ button and assigned by Google to the
                respective Google+ account of the person concerned.
                <br>
                If the person concerned activates one of the Google+ buttons integrated on our website and
                thereby makes a Google+ +1 recommendation, Google assigns this information to the
                personal Google+ user account of the person concerned and saves this personal
                data. Google stores the Google +1 recommendation of the person concerned and makes it
                publicly available in accordance with the terms and conditions accepted by the person
                concerned in this regard. A Google +1 recommendation made by the person concerned on
                this website is subsequently stored in other Google services together with other personal
                data, such as the name of the Google +1 account used by the person concerned and the
                photo stored in it, for example the search engine results of the Google search engine, The
                data subject&#39;s Google account or other locations, for example on websites or in connection
                with advertisements, are stored and processed. Furthermore, Google is able to link the visit to
                this website with other personal data stored by Google. Google also records this personal
                information with the purpose of improving or optimizing the various Google services.<br>
                Via the Google+ button, Google always receives information that the person concerned has
                visited our website if the person concerned is logged in to Google+ at the same time as
                accessing our website; this takes place regardless of whether the person concerned clicks
                the Google+ button or not.<br>
                If the person concerned does not want personal data to be transmitted to Google, they can
                prevent such transmission by logging out of their Google+ account before calling up our
                website.<br>

            <h4>17. DATA PROTECTION PROVISIONS ON THE
                APPLICATION AND USE OF LINKEDIN</h4>
            <p>
                The controller has integrated components of the LinkedIn Corporation on this
                website. LinkedIn is an Internet-based social network that enables users to connect with
                existing business contacts and make new business contacts. Over 400 million registered
                people use LinkedIn in more than 200 countries. This makes LinkedIn currently the largest
                platform for business contacts and one of the most visited websites in the world.<br>
                LinkedIn is operated by the LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA
                94043, USA. LinkedIn Ireland, Privacy Policy Issues, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2,
                Ireland, is responsible for data protection matters outside the USA. <br>
                Each time you visit our website, which is equipped with a LinkedIn component (LinkedIn
                plug-in), this component causes the browser used by the person concerned to download a
                corresponding representation of the LinkedIn component. Further information on the
                LinkedIn plug-ins can be found at

                    target="_blank">https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins</a>. As part of this
                technical process, LinkedIn gains knowledge of which specific subpage of our website is
                visited by the person concerned.<br>
                If the person concerned is logged in to LinkedIn at the same time, LinkedIn recognizes which
                specific sub-page of our website the person concerned is visiting with each visit to our
                website by the person concerned and for the entire duration of the respective stay on our
                website. This information is collected by the LinkedIn component and assigned to the
                respective LinkedIn account of the data subject by LinkedIn. If the person concerned
                activates a LinkedIn button integrated on our website, LinkedIn assigns this information to the
                personal LinkedIn user account of the person concerned and saves this personal data.
                <br>
                LinkedIn always receives information via the LinkedIn component that the person concerned
                has visited our website if the person concerned is logged in to LinkedIn at the same time as
                accessing our website; this takes place regardless of whether the person concerned clicks on
                the LinkedIn component or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be
                transmitted to LinkedIn, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their LinkedIn
                account before calling up our website.<br>

            </p>
            <h4>21. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING</h4>
            <p>
                Art. 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations for
                which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data
                is necessary to fulfill a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for
                example,
                with processing operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of
                other services or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same
                applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures,
                for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to
                a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, for example to fulfill tax
                obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, it may be necessary
                to process personal data in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another
                natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our company were injured
                and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a
                doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d
                GDPR are based. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f
                GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases
                are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest
                of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms
                of the data subject do not prevail. We are particularly permitted to carry out such processing
                operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this
                respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person
                concerned is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR). if the processing is
                necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that
                the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not prevail. We
                are particularly permitted to carry out such processing operations because they have been
                specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a
                legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the controller
                (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR). if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest
                of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms
                of the person concerned do not prevail. We are particularly permitted to carry out such
                processing operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European
                legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the
                person concerned is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).
            </p>

            <h4>22. LEGITIMATE INTERESTS IN PROCESSING THAT ARE BEING PURSUED BY THE
                CONTROLLER OR A THIRD PARTY</h4>
            <p>
                If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO is our legitimate
                interest
                in conducting our business for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our
                shareholders.
            </p>

            <h4>23. DURATION FOR WHICH THE PERSONAL
                DATA WILL BE STORED</h4>
            <p>
                The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory
                retention period. After the deadline has expired, the relevant data is routinely deleted,
                provided that it is no longer required for contract fulfillment or contract initiation.</p>
            <h4>24. LEGAL OR CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS
                FOR THE PROVISION OF PERSONAL
                DATA; NECESSITY FOR THE CONCLUSION OF
                THE CONTRACT; OBLIGATION OF THE DATA
                SUBJECT TO PROVIDE THE PERSONAL DATA; POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF NON-
                PROVISION</h4>
            <p>
                We would like to inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.
                tax regulations) or can also result from contractual regulations (e.g. information on the
                contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded that a
                person concerned provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed
                by us. For example, the person concerned is obliged to provide us with personal data if our
                company concludes a contract with him/her. Failure to provide the personal data would
                mean that the contract with the person concerned could not be concluded. Before the
                person concerned makes personal data available, the person concerned must contact one of
                our employees. Our employee will inform the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether
                the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the
                conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and
                what the consequences would be if the personal data were not provided.
