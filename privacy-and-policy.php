                    <p>
                        Thank you for your interest in our company. Data protection is of a particularly high priority
                        for
                        the management of Tvarit GmbH. The Tvarit GmbH website can be used without providing
                        any personal data. However, if a data subject wishes to make use of our company&#39;s special
                        services via our website, it may be necessary to process personal data. If the processing of
                        personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we generally
                        obtain the consent of the person concerned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The processing of personal data, for example the name, address, e-mail address or
                        telephone number of a person concerned, always takes place in accordance with the
                        General Data Protection Regulation and in accordance with the country-specific data
                        protection regulations applicable to Tvarit GmbH. With this data protection declaration, our
                        company would like to inform the public about the type, scope and purpose of the personal
                        data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed about their rights
                        by means of this data protection declaration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the controller, Tvarit GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational
                        measures to ensure the most complete protection possible for personal data processed via
                        this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions can generally have security gaps,
                        so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every person concerned is
                        free to transmit personal data to us in alternative ways, for example by telephone.
                    </p>
                    <span class="mainHeading">1. DEFINITION</span>
                    <p>
                        The data protection declaration of Tvarit GmbH is based on the terms used by the European
                        legislator for directives and regulations when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
                        was adopted. Our data protection declaration should be easy to read and understand for the
                        public as well as for our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to
                        explain the terms used in advance.
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        The Tvarit GmbH website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored on a computer
                        system via an internet browser.<br>
                        Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A
                        cookie ID is a unique identifier for the cookie. It consists of a string of characters through
                        which websites and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the
                        cookie was stored. This enables the visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual
                        browser of the person concerned from other internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
                        specific internet browser can be recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID.<br>
                        By using cookies, Tvarit GmbH can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly
                        services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.<br>
                        A cookie can be used to optimize the information and offers on our website in the interests of
                        the user. As already mentioned, cookies enable us to recognize the users of our website. The
                        purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. The user of a
                        website that uses cookies, for example, does not have to re-enter their access data every
                        time they visit the website, because this is done by the website and the cookie stored on the
                        user&#39;s computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in the online
                        shop. The online shop uses a cookie to remember the items that a customer has placed in
                        the virtual shopping cart.<br>
                        The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by
                        means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object
                        to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at
                        any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common
                        internet browsers. If the person concerned deactivates the setting of cookies in the internet
                        browser used, not all functions of our website may be fully usable.<br>
                    </p>
                    <span class="mainHeading">4. COLLECTION OF GENERAL DATA AND INFORMATION</span>
                    <p>
                        The Tvarit GmbH website collects a series of general data and information each time the
                        website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system. These general data and
                        information are stored in the server&#39;s log files. The <br>
                        (1) browser types and versions used,<br>
                        (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, <br>
                        (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrer), <br>
                        (4) the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website can be controlled,
                        <br>
                        (5) the date and time of access to the website, <br>
                        (6) an internet protocol address (IP address), <br>
                        (7) the internet service provider of the accessing system and <br>
                        (8) other similar data and information,<br>
                        When using this general data and information, Tvarit GmbH does not draw any conclusions
                        about the person concerned. Rather, this information is required to <br>
                        (1) correctly deliver the content of our website, <br>
                        (2) optimize the content of our website and the advertising for it,
                        (3) ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the
                        technology of our website and <br>
                        (4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the
                        information necessary for law enforcement in the event of a cyber-attack. This anonymously
                        collected data and information is therefore evaluated by Tvarit GmbH on the one hand
                        statistically and on the other hand with the aim of increasing data protection and data
                        security in our company, in order to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the
                        personal data we process. The anonymous data in the server log files are stored separately
                        from all personal data provided by a data subject.
                    </p>
                    <span class="mainHeading">5. REGISTRATION ON OUR WEBSITE</span>
                    <p>
                        The data subject has the option of registering on the website of the person responsible for
                        processing by providing personal data. Which personal data is transmitted to the person
                        responsible for processing results from the respective input mask that is used for
                        registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored
                        exclusively for internal use by the person responsible for processing and for their own
                        purposes. The person responsible for processing can arrange for the data to be passed on to

                        investigated. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary to protect the person
                        responsible for processing. This data will not be passed on to third parties unless there is a
                        legal obligation to pass on or the passing on is used for criminal prosecution.<br>
                        The registration of the data subject with the voluntary provision of personal data enables the
                        data controller to offer the data subject content or services which, due to the nature of the
                        matter, can only be offered to registered users. Registered persons are free to change the
                        personal data provided during registration at any time or to have them completely deleted
                        from the database of the person responsible for processing.<br>
                        The person responsible for processing provides information to each person concerned at any
                        time upon request about which personal data is stored about the person
                        concerned. Furthermore, the person responsible for processing corrects or deletes personal
                        data at the request or advice of the person concerned, provided that there are no legal
                        retention requirements. All employees of the person responsible for processing are available

                    <p>
                        On the Tvarit GmbH website, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our company&#39;s
                        newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines which personal data is
                        transmitted to the person responsible for processing when ordering the newsletter.<br>
                        Tvarit GmbH informs its customers and business partners at regular intervals by means of a
                        newsletter about company offers. Our company&#39;s newsletter can only be received by the
                        person concerned if <br>
                        (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and <br>
                        (2) the person concerned registers to receive the newsletter.<br> 
                        For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered for the
                        first time by a person concerned for the newsletter
                        dispatch using the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation email is used to check whether
                        the owner of the email address, as the person concerned, has authorized receipt of the
                        newsletter.<br>
                        When registering for the newsletter, we also store the IP address assigned by the Internet
                        service provider (ISP) of the computer system used by the person concerned at the time of
                        registration, as well as the date and time of registration. The collection of this data is
                        necessary in order to be able to trace the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data
                        subject at a later point in time and therefore serves the legal protection of the person
                        responsible for the processing.<br>
                        The personal data collected when registering for the newsletter will only be used to send our
                        newsletter. Furthermore, subscribers to the newsletter could be informed by e-mail if this is
                        necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a related registration, as this could
                        be
                        the case in the case of changes to the newsletter offer or changes in the technical
                        conditions. The personal data collected as part of the newsletter service is not passed on to
                        third parties. The data subject can cancel the subscription to our newsletter at any time. The
                        consent to the storage of personal data that the person concerned has given us for sending
                        the newsletter can be revoked at any time. There is a corresponding link in every newsletter
                        for the purpose of withdrawing consent. Furthermore, there is the option of unsubscribing
                        from the newsletter dispatch directly on the website of the person responsible for processing
                        or to inform the person responsible for processing of this in another way.<br>

                    <span class="mainHeading">7. NEWSLETTER TRACKING</span>
                    <p>
                        The Tvarit GmbH newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature
                        graphic that is embedded in such e-mails that are sent in HTML format to enable log file
                        recording and log file analysis. This enables a statistical evaluation of the success or failure
                        of
                        online marketing campaigns to be carried out. Using the embedded tracking pixel, Tvarit
                        GmbH can recognize whether and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject and which
                        links in the e-mail were called up by the data subject.<br>
                        Such personal data collected via the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored
                        and evaluated by the person responsible for processing in order to optimize the sending of
                        the newsletter and to better adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the
                        person concerned. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Affected
                        persons are entitled at any time to revoke the relevant separate declaration of consent given
                        via the double opt-in procedure. After a revocation, this personal data will be deleted by the
                        person responsible for processing. Tvarit GmbH automatically interprets a cancellation from
                        the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.

                    <p>
                        Due to legal regulations, the Tvarit GmbH website contains information that enables quick
                        electronic contact with our company and direct communication with us, which also includes
                        a general address for so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the
                        person responsible for processing by email or a contact form, the personal data transmitted
                        by the data subject will be automatically saved. Such personal data transmitted on a
                        voluntary basis by a data subject to the person responsible for processing are stored for the
                        purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.

                    <span class="mainHeading">9. COMMENT FUNCTION IN THE BLOG ON THE WEBSITE</span>
                    <p>
                        Tvarit GmbH offers users the opportunity to leave individual comments on individual blog
                        posts on a blog located on the website of the controller. A blog is a website that is usually
                        open to the public and in which one or more people called bloggers or web bloggers can
                        post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blog posts. The blog posts can usually be
                        commented on by third parties.<br>
                        If a person concerned leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, in addition to
                        the comments left by the person concerned, information on the time the comment was
                        entered and the user name (pseudonym) chosen by the person concerned are stored and
                        published. Furthermore, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the
                        person concerned is also logged. The IP address is stored for security reasons and in the
                        event that the person concerned violates the rights of third parties or posts illegal content by
                        submitting a comment. The storage of this personal data is therefore in the own interest of
                        the person responsible for the processing, so that he can exculpate himself in the event of an
                        infringement.

                        parties. In particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments on
                        a specific blog post that follow his comment.<br>
                        If a data subject opts for the option to subscribe to comments, the person responsible for
                        processing sends an automatic confirmation e-mail in order to use the double opt-in
                        procedure to check whether the owner of the e-mail address provided is really the same
                        Option has decided. The option to subscribe to comments can be canceled at any time.

                    controller, is obliged to delete the personal data in accordance with Art. 17 Paragraph
                    1 GDPR, Tvarit GmbH will take appropriate measures, taking into account the available
                    technology and the implementation costs of a technical nature, in order to inform
                    other data processors who process the published personal data that the data subject
                    has requested the deletion of all links to this personal data or of copies or replications
                    of this personal data from these other data processors has requested, as far as the
                    processing is not necessary. The employee of Tvarit GmbH will arrange the necessary
                    in individual cases.<br>

                    <span class="subHeading"> E) RIGHT TO RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING</span><br>
                    Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
                    European legislator of directives and regulations to demand that the controller restrict
                    the processing if one of the following conditions is met:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The correctness of the personal data is contested by the data subject for a
                            period of time that enables the controller to check the correctness of the
                            personal data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The processing is unlawful, the person concerned refuses to delete the
                            personal data and instead requests that the use of the personal data be
                            restricted.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of
                            processing, but the person concerned needs them to assert, exercise or
                            defend legal claims.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The person concerned has an objection to the processing in accordance
                            with. Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and it has not yet been determined whether the
                            legitimate reasons of the controller outweigh those of the person concerned.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    If one of the above conditions is met and a data subject would like to request the
                    restriction of personal data stored at Tvarit GmbH, they can contact an employee of
                    the person responsible for processing at any time. The employee of Tvarit GmbH will
                    arrange for the processing to be restricted.<br>

                    <span class="subHeading"> F) RIGHT TO DATA PORTABILITY</span><br>
                    Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
                    European legislator of directives and regulations to receive the personal data
                    concerning them, which have been provided by the person concerned to a controller,
                    in a structured, common and machine-readable format. You also have the right to
                    transfer this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to whom
                    the personal data was provided, provided that the processing is based on the consent
                    in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 Letter a GDPR or Art. 9 Para 2 letter a DS-GVO or on a
                    contract according to Art. 6 para. 1 letter b DS-GVO and the processing is carried out
                    using automated procedures,<br>
                    Furthermore, when exercising their right to data portability in accordance with Art. 20
                    (1) GDPR, the person concerned has the right to have the personal data transmitted
                    directly from one controller to another, insofar as this is technically feasible and if this
                    does not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.<br>
                    In order to assert the right to data portability, the person concerned can contact an
                    employee of Tvarit GmbH at any time.<br>

                    <span class="subHeading"> G) RIGHT TO OBJECT</span><br>
                    Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the

                    provisions.<br>
                    In the event of an objection, Tvarit GmbH will no longer process the personal data,
                    unless we can prove compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that outweigh
                    the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves to
                    assert, exercise or defend of legal claims.<br>
                    If Tvarit GmbH processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data
                    subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for the
                    purpose of such marketing. This also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such
                    direct marketing. If the data subject objects to Tvarit GmbH processing for the
                    purposes of direct marketing, Tvarit GmbH will no longer process the personal data
                    for these purposes.<br>
                    In addition, the data subject has the right, for reasons arising from their particular
                    situation, to object to the processing of personal data concerning them that is carried
                    out by Tvarit GmbH for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical
                    purposes in accordance with Art. 89 Para. 1 DS- GMOs, to object, unless such
                    processing is necessary to fulfill a task in the public interest.<br>
                    To exercise the right to object, the person concerned can contact any employee of
                    Tvarit GmbH or another employee directly. The data subject is also free, in connection
                    with the use of information society services, regardless of Directive 2002/58 / EC, to
                    exercise their right of objection by means of automated procedures in which technical

                    <p>
                        The person responsible for processing collects and processes the personal data of
                        applicants for the purpose of handling the application process. The processing can also be
                        done electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant sends the relevant
                        application
                        documents electronically, for example by e-mail or via a web form on the website, to the
                        person responsible for processing. If the person responsible for processing concludes an
                        employment contract with an applicant, the data transmitted will be stored for the purpose of
                        processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If the

                        this sense is, for example, a burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal
                        Treatment Act (AGG).

                        The person responsible for processing has integrated components of the company

                        A social network is a social meeting place operated on the Internet, an online community that
                        usually enables users to communicate with one another and to interact in virtual space. A
                        social network can serve as a platform for exchanging opinions and experiences, or it enables
                        the Internet community to provide personal or company-related information. Among other
                        things, Facebook enables users of the social network to create private profiles, upload
                        photos and network via friend requests.<br>
                        The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025,
                        USA. If a data subject lives outside the USA or Canada, the person responsible for processing
                        personal data is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2,
                        Ireland.<br>
                        Each time one of the individual pages of this website is called up, which is operated by the
                        person responsible for processing and on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in)
                        has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
                        person concerned is automatically activated by the respective Facebook -Component
                        causes a representation of the corresponding Facebook component to be downloaded from
                        Facebook. A complete overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at

                        this technical
                        process, Facebook receives knowledge of which specific subpage of our website is visited by
                        the person concerned.<br>
                        If the person concerned is logged in to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes
                        which specific subpage of our website the person concerned is visiting each time the person
                        concerned visits our website and for the entire duration of their stay on our website. This
                        information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned to the respective
                        Facebook account of the person concerned by Facebook. If the person concerned activates
                        one of the Facebook buttons integrated on our website, for example the “Like” button, or if
                        the person concerned makes a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the
                        concerned person’s personal Facebook user account and saves this personal data.<br>
                        Facebook always receives information via the Facebook component that the person
                        concerned has visited our website if the person concerned is logged into Facebook at the
                        same time as accessing our website; this takes place regardless of whether the person
                        concerned clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the data subject does not want this
                        information to be transmitted to Facebook, they can prevent the transmission by logging out
                        of their Facebook account before calling up our website.<br>

                        protect the privacy of the data subject. Various applications are also available that make it
                        possible to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the

                        anonymization function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web
                        analysis is the gathering, collection and evaluation of data on the behavior of visitors to
                        websites. A web analysis service collects, among other things, data on the website from
                        which a person concerned came to a website (so-called referrer), which sub-pages of the
                        website were accessed or how often and for how long a sub-page was viewed. A web
                        analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of Internet
                        advertising. <br>
                        The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited,
                        Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.<br>
                        The person responsible for processing uses the addition &quot;_gat._anonymizeIp&quot; for web
                        analysis
                        via Google Analytics. By means of this addition, the IP address of the Internet connection of
                        the person concerned is shortened and anonymized by Google if our Internet pages are

                        website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other things, to evaluate the
                        use of our website, to compile online reports for us that show the activities on our website,
                        and to provide other services related to the use of our website.<br>
                        Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the person
                        concerned. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie,
                        Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. Each time one of the individual pages of

                        which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the
                        information technology system of the person concerned is automatically triggered by the
                        respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online
                        analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such
                        as the IP address of the person concerned, which Google uses, among other things, to trace
                        the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently to enable commission settlements.<br>
                        The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from

                        above, at any time by means of a corresponding setting in the Internet browser used and
                        thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the internet browser used
                        would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of

                        The person responsible for processing has integrated the Google+ button as a component on
                        this website. Google+ is a so-called social network. A social network is a social meeting place
                        operated on the Internet, an online community that usually enables users to communicate
                        with one another and interact in virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for
                        exchanging opinions and experiences, or it enables the Internet community to provide
                        personal or company-related information. Google+ enables users of the social network,
                        among other things, to create private profiles, upload photos and network via friend
                        requests.<br>
                        Google+ is operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04

                        Each time one of the individual pages of this website is accessed, which is operated by the
                        person responsible for processing and on which a Google+ button has been integrated, the
                        Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is
                        automatically prompted by the respective Google+ button to display the corresponding
                        Google+ Download button from Google. As part of this technical process, Google gains
                        knowledge of which specific subpage of our website is visited by the person

                        respective Google+ account of the person concerned.
                        <br>
                        If the person concerned activates one of the Google+ buttons integrated on our website and
                        thereby makes a Google+ +1 recommendation, Google assigns this information to the

                        YOUTUBE</span>
                    <p>
                        The data controller has integrated components from YouTube on this website. YouTube is an
                        Internet video portal that enables video publishers to post video clips free of charge and
                        other users to view, rate and comment on them free of charge. YouTube allows the
                        publication of all types of videos, which is why complete film and TV programs, but also
                        music videos, trailers or videos made by users themselves can be accessed via the Internet
                        portal.<br>
                        YouTube is operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04
                        E5W5, Ireland.<br>
                        Each time one of the individual pages of this website is accessed, which is operated by the
                        person responsible for processing and on which a YouTube component (YouTube video) has
                        been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person
                        concerned is automatically replaced by the respective YouTube component prompts you to
                        download a representation of the corresponding YouTube component from
                        YouTube. Further information about YouTube can be found at
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/" target="_blank">
                            https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/ </a>. As part of this technical process, YouTube and
                        Google gain knowledge of which specific subpage of our website is visited by the person
                        concerned.<br>
                        If the person concerned is logged into YouTube at the same time, YouTube recognizes which
                        specific sub-page of our website the person concerned is visiting by calling up a subpage
                        that contains a YouTube video. This information is collected by YouTube and Google and
                        assigned to the respective YouTube account of the person concerned. <br>
                        YouTube and Google always receive information via the YouTube component that the
                        person concerned has visited our website if the person concerned is logged in to YouTube at
                        the same time as accessing our website; this takes place regardless of whether the person
                        concerned clicks on a YouTube video or not. If the data subject does not want this
                        information to be transmitted to YouTube and Google, they can prevent the transmission by
                        logging out of their YouTube account before calling up our website.

                    <span class="mainHeading">21. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING</span>
                    <p>
                        Art. 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations for
                        which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data
                        is necessary to fulfill a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for
                        example,
                        with processing operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of
                        other services or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same
                        applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures,
                        for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to
                        a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, for example to fulfill tax
                        obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, it may be necessary
                        to process personal data in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another
                        natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our company were injured
                        and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a
                        doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d
                        GDPR are based. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f
                        GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases
                        are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest
                        of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms
                        of the data subject do not prevail. We are particularly permitted to carry out such processing
                        operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this
                        respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the person
                        concerned is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR). if the processing is
                        necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that
                        the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned do not prevail. We
                        are particularly permitted to carry out such processing operations because they have been
                        specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a
                        legitimate interest could be assumed if the person concerned is a customer of the controller
                        (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR). if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest
                        of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms
                        of the person concerned do not prevail. We are particularly permitted to carry out such
                        processing operations because they have been specifically mentioned by the European
                        legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the
                        person concerned is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 GDPR).

                        If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO is our legitimate

                    <p>
                        The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory
                        retention period. After the deadline has expired, the relevant data is routinely deleted,
                        provided that it is no longer required for contract fulfillment or contract initiation.</p>

                        FOR THE PROVISION OF PERSONAL
                        DATA; NECESSITY FOR THE CONCLUSION OF
                        THE CONTRACT; OBLIGATION OF THE DATA
                        SUBJECT TO PROVIDE THE PERSONAL DATA; POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF NON-
                        PROVISION</span>
                    <p>
                        We would like to inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.
                        tax regulations) or can also result from contractual regulations (e.g. information on the
                        contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded that a
                        person concerned provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed
                        by us. For example, the person concerned is obliged to provide us with personal data if our
                        company concludes a contract with him/her. Failure to provide the personal data would
                        mean that the contract with the person concerned could not be concluded. Before the
                        person concerned makes personal data available, the person concerned must contact one of
                        our employees. Our employee will inform the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether
                        the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the
                        conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and
                        what the consequences would be if the personal data were not provided.
